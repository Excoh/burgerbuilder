# Burger Builder 

Are you tired of restaurants that force you to chose from 10 preset burgers? After your  tenth, you decide there's just nothing new or exciting for you anymore. That's why we developed Burger Builder! 

Your burger should be as unique as your fingerprint. Our hack is an intuitive and simple web application where you can order any burger you could possibly dream ofâ€”possibilities are truly endless. Order and see the price of your burger. We hope to add more ingredients and more functionalities in the near future.
